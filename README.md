# CyberLabs Template

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.5. This app has been designed as a UI template for my Senior Project's CyberLabs environment so we can begin database integration and Proxmox integration for the VM view. 

You can view a live test site with the following link[Live Test Site](https://zacharycvivian.github.io/angular-cyberlabs-app/login). Since this is only the template and is being published on a GitHub Pages site, the MySQL database and Proxmox VE environment is not connected for security reasons. Speaking of which, this version also does not have proper authentication or any security implementations, meaning you can navigate to the various URL's without being 'logged in'. This template is not to be used for any purposes except by students at the University of Wisconsin - Platteville, I simply have it in this repository to demonstrate my work. Thank you.
